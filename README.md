# Bid Zone

Bid Zone is a terminal-based auction system inspired by the IPL auction model.
It simulates a real-time bidding environment where teams compete to buy players
within a fixed purse.

# Core Idea

- Players are auctioned one by one
- Teams place bids until a player’s auction is finalized
- Players are marked as sold or unsold
- Every auction starts from scratch (no previous history)
